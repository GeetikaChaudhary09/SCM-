A merge conflict occurs in Git when two branches being merged have changes to the same part of a file that cannot be automatically resolved.
Git attempts to merge the branches, but when conflicting changes exist, it flags the conflict for manual resolution.
The  command is used to create a copy (or "clone") of an existing repository. This allows you to work on a local version of the project while remaining connected to its remote repository.
